# The Effects of Dirty Air towards Throttle Application

**Max Verstappen Throttle Application in Dirty Air vs Clean Air**

During the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen achieved a remarkable feat by breaking Sebastian Vettel's longstanding record of nine consecutive wins. This achievement, however, was far from straightforward, as Verstappen had to contend with the aggressive and defensively skilled Spanish driver, Carlos Sainz, in a fierce battle for the lead.

The process of overtaking Carlos Sainz proved to be a strategic challenge for Max Verstappen, taking a total of 15 laps. Sainz adeptly defended his position by consistently maintaining the optimal racing line in each corner, making it difficult for Verstappen to initiate an attack. Sainz also displayed proficiency in managing his Energy Recovery System (ERS), allowing him to accumulate a surplus of ERS energy for strategic deployment on the long straightaways, effectively thwarting Verstappen's attempts to pass him in the formidable RB19.

As the race progressed, Max Verstappen encountered difficulties maintaining pace with Carlos Sainz due to the adverse effects of "dirty air," particularly noticeable in the final corner, Parabolica. The commentators also highlighted the fact that Verstappen had to exercise caution and momentarily delay throttle application while navigating within Sainz's turbulent wake.

The term "dirty air" is commonly employed in Formula 1 to describe the situation where a car is situated behind another, causing turbulent air that disrupts the car's aerodynamics and diminishes its downforce. Racing under these conditions is commonly referred to as racing in "dirty air." It's worth noting that the presence of dirty air can also impact the engine cooling system.

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, multiple laps were selected as representative samples of both "dirty air" (Laps 5 and 10) and "clean air" (Lap 15). Telemetry data was subsequently processed using Python programming. The resulting visualizations clearly illustrate the significant impact of dirty air on the aerodynamic performance of a Formula 1 car. In clean air conditions, throttle application can occur substantially earlier, and braking can be delayed to a greater extent.
